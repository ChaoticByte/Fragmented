If you find this inside the project template, editing these gdshaderinc files
does nothing. They are already packed with the application and are only here
for you and the Godot Editor to read (auto complete and so on).

If you want to change one of the files, copy it to another location,
edit it and #include it in your shader file.

If you have questions, don't be shy, open a issue :)

Have fun experimenting!
